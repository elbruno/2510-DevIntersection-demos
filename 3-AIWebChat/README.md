# 2-AIWebChat

This folder contains the AI Web Chat sample used in the demos. Build outputs and Visual Studio artifacts are excluded (see the repository `.gitignore`).

Structure:

- `1.start/AIWebChat-HF-AIFoundry.ServiceDefaults/` — starter project (source may be omitted here; build artifacts excluded)
- `2.complete/AIWebChat-HF-AIFoundry.AppHost/` — completed project

Note: Git does not track empty directories. Small placeholder files (.gitkeep) are included in each subproject folder so the folder structure appears on the remote repository.
